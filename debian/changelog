fortio (1.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Skip tests by default (because build machines don't have internet access)
  * Added override for Chart.min.js so to not having to further completely
    revamp the build system for that one file (which does have a header
    indicating source and (MIT) license)
